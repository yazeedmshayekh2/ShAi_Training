our model should learn from classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds ,and be able to predict the diamond price . Features :

price : price in US dollars ($326--$18,823)

carat: weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

Carat is the unit of measurement for the physical weight of diamonds. One carat equals 0.200 grams or 1/5 gram and is subdivided into 100 points. For comparison, in units more familiar in the United States, one carat equals 0.007 ounce avoirdupois. Which would require over 2,265 carats to equal 1 pound!

cut :quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

The cut of a diamond refers to how well the diamond’s facets interact with light, the proportions of the diamond, and the overall finish of the diamond.

It is not to be confused with the shape, (like emerald or round,) or facet arrangement, (like brilliant, or step cut), but is instead a reference to the craftsmanship of the diamond and how it factors into the diamond’s brilliance.

color :diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best)

The Color of a diamond actually refers to the lack of color in a diamond, with perfectly colorless diamonds considered the highest quality with the highest value, and brown or yellow diamonds being the lowest quality.

clarity: a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

Clarity is the state of being clear or transparent. Diamond clarity is the presence or absence of characteristics called inclusions in the diamond.

When grading the clarity of a diamond, the lab determines the relative visibility of the inclusions in a diamond and their impact on the overall visual appearance.

So, what are these inclusions that affect clarity? In short, inclusions are the internal or external flaws of the diamond. The size and severity of these flaws determines the grade.

x :length in mm (0--10.74)

y :width in mm (0--58.9)

z :depth in mm (0--31.8)

depth :total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)

table :width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)

The depth of a diamond might also be called the “height”: it is the distance from the table to the culet (the pointed tip) of the diamond.

Like with a diamond’s table, jewelers grade a diamond’s depth based on its depth percentage. You will notice two measurements of the depth on your diamond grading report; one will record the actual depth measurement in millimetres, the other is the depth percentage which notes how deep the diamond is in relation to its width. A depth percentage can be treated as an indicator of a diamonds value and brilliance. The depth of a diamond can also help to make a modest diamond appear larger. This percentage dictates the overall proportions of the diamond, which in turn directly impact how light reflects off the facets in the stone.

Depth percentage is the diamond’s depth divided by the width of the diamond.

Have you ever noticed that nearly every diamond has a flat, square-shaped facet on its top? This flat facet is called the table, and it plays a critical role in a diamond’s appearance. The table refracts rays of light as they pass, directing them to the facets that make the diamond look so sparkly.

The ideal table percentage will vary based on the shape of your diamond. For example, the ideal table for round-cut diamonds is between 54-60 percent, while the ideal dimensions for emerald-cut diamonds puts table percentage between 66-72 percent.

The diamond table percentage is a parameter obtained by dividing the width of the table portion by the width of the entire diamond. For instance, if the table is 2.5 mm wide and the diameter of the diamond is 5 mm, the table percentage is 50%.

If the diamond table percentage is too large, then the light will be prevented from reflecting off the diamond’s crown facets and angles. This means the beautiful reflections will not be seen as the light will escape from the top of the diamond and will not reach the eyes.

If the diamond table percentage is too low, the light will escape through other parts of the diamond instead of finding its way to the eye.
